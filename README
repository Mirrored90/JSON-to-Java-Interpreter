This is a Java class builder that takes JSON file as input and outputs corresponding compileable Java classsource code as well as its public set and get methods. 
The class builder can serialize instantiated Java objects back to JSON files by using memoization DFS. The automatically generated deserialization method can reconstruct Java objects.
To run the code, please run "gradle run".
