Reflection:

1. I overestimated parsing JSON file to build java classes. And I underestimated
   serialiation and deserialization. I found it was really hard to deal with cycled
   classes (i.e. class that contains classes). Because in that case, we need to handle
   everything recursively and take care of every possible input types.

2. I did not really follow my plan. I spent most of my time in serialiation and
   deserialization, which was highly overestimated by my plan.

3.
  o I don't think it will be very difficult to change the whole project into other
    languages as long as I know this language. Because I have already implemented whole
    project, I known the design behind it. So it's noting but implementation.
  o It will be hard if input is changed from JSON to XML files. Because the
    underlying design may be no longer compatible and we need to do everything form the
    very beginning.
  o It will be very hard to do. Because we not only have to take care of XML files, we
    but also need to make it compatible with JSON files.

4. I will not try to use Reflection library functions. I spent a lot of time trying to
   Reflection library to achieve serialiation, which turned out nothing and wasted me
   bunch of time.

5. Start plan as soon as possible. Make a good plan and stick to it. In my future study
   or career, when I start a new thing, I will try to grasp the whole picture and then
   break it down into small peices.
